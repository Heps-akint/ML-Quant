The goal of this research project is to learn about three cutting-edge trading strategies to enhance my financial knowledge and toolkit. I'll explore the Unsupervised Learning Trading Strategy, utilizing S&P 500 stocks data to master features, indicators, and portfolio optimization.

Next, I'll leverage the power of social media with the Twitter Sentiment Investing Strategy, ranking NASDAQ stocks based on engagement and evaluating performance against the QQQ return. Lastly, I'll use the GARCH model for applying an Intraday Strategy, combining it with technical indicators to capture both daily and intraday signals for potential lucrative positions.
